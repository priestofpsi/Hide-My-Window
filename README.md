# Hide-My-Window

This application started out as a side line project to find out how to hook onto forms within windows, as well as how to create
global windows hooks. At the same time I was trying to find an application that I could use to hide/show open windows quickly
and easily. I found many applications that where supposed to do this, but none of them met my needs or even actually worked on 
64 bit Windows 7 or Windows 10, so I ended up writing this.

It is nothing fancy, it is still in progress and many idea's still do implement on it.

Use it, don't use it... it helps me hide my porn quickly when needed (j/k) :)
